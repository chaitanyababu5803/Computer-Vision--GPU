Job description
We are seeking a Software Engineer Computer Vision & AI with strong software engineering skills and deep expertise in computer vision and AI. You will design, develop, and optimize advanced vision solutions, taking them from prototypes to production-ready deployments in cloud and on-prem environments. This role requires strong proficiency in Python, cloud deployment, and containerized workflows, with the ability to handle complex real-world datasets from images, videos, and LiDAR sensors.

Responsibilities

Develop and maintain high-performance computer vision applications using Python and C++.
Implement and optimize algorithms for image, video, and LiDAR-based analysis using frameworks like OpenCV, PyTorch, and related libraries.
Optimize vision pipelines for real-time performance on GPUs, vision accelerators, and edge devices.
Build scalable and containerized solutions using Docker and deploy them on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate vision modules into larger AI/ML workflows and production systems.
Troubleshoot, debug, and enhance existing codebases for efficiency, scalability, and robustness.
Ensure best practices in software design, coding standards, and CI/CD pipelines.
Qualifications

Must Have:
Advanced proficiency in Python (including async programming, generators, multiprocessing, and design patterns).
Strong experience in Computer Vision libraries such as OpenCV, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.
Proficiency in C++ for performance-critical modules.
Hands-on experience with GPU acceleration and CUDA or equivalent frameworks.
Strong expertise in Docker for containerization and cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
Familiarity with parallel and concurrent programming.
Strong understanding of Linux systems and performance optimization.
Knowledge of best practices for clean, maintainable, and production-ready code.

Good to Have:
Experience with visual-SLAM or LiDAR-based SLAM systems.
Knowledge of bpy (Blender Python API) scripting for automation and 3D workflows.
Experience with robotics frameworks (ROS/ROS2) or real-time sensor data processing.

Computer-Vision GPU
For computer vision tasks, NVIDIA GPUs are generally preferred due to the robust CUDA ecosystem and specialized hardware like Tensor Cores, which accelerate deep learning workloads. The ideal GPU depends on your specific workload, budget, and scalability needs. 

Key Features to Consider
When choosing a GPU for computer vision, prioritize the following characteristics: 

VRAM (Video Memory) Amount: Crucial for handling large datasets and models (e.g., high-resolution images, large neural networks). More VRAM allows you to train larger models or use larger batch sizes.
CUDA Cores/Stream Processors: These are the individual processing units that perform parallel calculations. More cores mean faster parallel processing, which is fundamental to deep learning.
Tensor Cores: NVIDIA GPUs feature these specialized cores designed to accelerate matrix operations, which are at the heart of AI and deep learning computations, significantly speeding up training and inference.
Memory Bandwidth: Determines how quickly data can move in and out of the VRAM. High bandwidth is vital to prevent bottlenecks when processing large volumes of data.
Software Ecosystem: NVIDIA's CUDA platform provides extensive, highly-optimized libraries (cuDNN, TensorRT) and broad framework support (TensorFlow, PyTorch). AMD's ROCm is an open-source alternative but has less mature support across all frameworks.
Precision Support: Modern GPUs support various precision formats (FP32, FP16, FP8) which affect speed and memory usage. Ensure the GPU supports the precision level required by your models.
