Job description
We are seeking a Software Engineer Computer Vision & AI with strong software engineering skills and deep expertise in computer vision and AI. You will design, develop, and optimize advanced vision solutions, taking them from prototypes to production-ready deployments in cloud and on-prem environments. This role requires strong proficiency in Python, cloud deployment, and containerized workflows, with the ability to handle complex real-world datasets from images, videos, and LiDAR sensors.

Responsibilities

Develop and maintain high-performance computer vision applications using Python and C++.
Implement and optimize algorithms for image, video, and LiDAR-based analysis using frameworks like OpenCV, PyTorch, and related libraries.
Optimize vision pipelines for real-time performance on GPUs, vision accelerators, and edge devices.
Build scalable and containerized solutions using Docker and deploy them on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate vision modules into larger AI/ML workflows and production systems.
Troubleshoot, debug, and enhance existing codebases for efficiency, scalability, and robustness.
Ensure best practices in software design, coding standards, and CI/CD pipelines.
Qualifications
Must Have:
Advanced proficiency in Python (including async programming, generators, multiprocessing, and design patterns).
Strong experience in Computer Vision libraries such as OpenCV, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.
Proficiency in C++ for performance-critical modules.
Hands-on experience with GPU acceleration and CUDA or equivalent frameworks.
Strong expertise in Docker for containerization and cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
Familiarity with parallel and concurrent programming.
Strong understanding of Linux systems and performance optimization.
Knowledge of best practices for clean, maintainable, and production-ready code.
Good to Have:
Experience with visual-SLAM or LiDAR-based SLAM systems.
Knowledge of bpy (Blender Python API) scripting for automation and 3D workflows.
Experience with robotics frameworks (ROS/ROS2) or real-time sensor data processing.
